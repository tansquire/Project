/var/www/html/indexa.php..........apache

I am doing one mini project with two aurduinos, one Respbary Pi, and one apache server(different machine). I have to  control the aurdino from webpage  , as well as get temperature reading from aurdino on the webpage. So communication will be like server to respbari pi to aurdino and vice versa. Can you help doing this project?I know php, mySQL, basic linux command , and basic python.

################Linux basic command############################
case sensitive
If any file or folder name is with space like    new folder   then use 'new folder' in command line, otherwise linux will take the first word
Let a directory: a/b/c/d and d is a folder, and we want to access d
Relative path: If I am inside b, then we have to write c/d
If I am inside a, we have to wrire b/c/d
If I am at c, we have to write d
If I am inside d then dont write anything. Now d means d/d, If there does not exist any d inside d, it will give an error
Fromany Directory root can be accessed, by simply writing ~. Fromany Directory home can be accessed by simply writing ~
folder means directory
a/b/c/ram.txt   means c is top level directory, and a/b/c is called whole directory
To get help of a command
man command,   example man ls

To see previous command entered, use history command

To clear the terminal use clear command
To copy from terminal ctrl+shift+C
To paste to terminal ctrl+shift+v

But  to copy and paste from and to a text file shift is not required

##########ls command##########
ls----show everything
ls -R-----show with hierarchically
ls -a-----show everything incl hiden
ls -al----show incl user group, permission, size, date of creation etc
ls -l---- also show incl user group, permission, size, date of creation etc
By default we are at hole directory
ls directoryname gives everything in thet dir
ls ~ will give everything of home dir
ls ..    show everything of previous dir
ls ../..     show everything previous to previous dir
ls -ls    show as per file size
ls directoryname/*.extentionname  shows all files of the same extention name
ls -ls>test.txt    a new txt file test will be created in the same directory. Test fill now contains all file and foldername of current directory
To see only directory 
ls -d */
#########################
##########cd command#######

cd dirictory name to to to the diectory
cd ..    previous directory
cd ~     default directory, i.e., home directory

################################
#########cat ##################

For text file we use cat command

cat > file1...creat file

then write something
then press cntr+D to go to command line

To see file,
cat file1
To see double file
cat file1 file2

Now creat another file, by cat > file2

write something

Cntr+D

Now to concatinate both file into a new file called file3,

cat file1 file2 >file3
Here cntr+D not required

cat file1>>file2  will update file2, file1 will be appended on file2

> is called redirection operator.For example  ls -l >test.tst  will create a new file containing the output of ls -l.

cat -b file name will add line no to non blank line
cat -n file name will add line no to all line
cat -s filename  will show file without unnecessary blank, if any in the the file
cat -E filename will add $ sign after each line
################## mv command #########################

To move, mv is used. mv filename directoryname, or mv dir1 dir2. To get a confirmation, mv -i dir1/file1 dir2
mv -v file1/dir1 dir2.........samething happens, but with explanation
To rename file, mv oldfilename newfilename
To rename a folder
mv oldfolder newfolder
###########################mkdir#########################
To make a new folder(directory) inside current directory,
mkdir foldername
mkdir a/b/c means inside a/b c folder will be created.

Let you are inside Desktop. now you want to create two folder a abd b such that b is inside a. Then mkdir -p a/b.
Let you are inside Desktop. now you want to create two folder a, b and c such that b, c are inside a. Then mkdir -p a/{b,c}---no space b/w b and c.
To make a new folder(directory) inside any directory,
mkdir desired_directory_name foldername

To create multiple directory,
mkdir folder1 folder2 folder3
################## rm command ########################
To delete file, rm filename
To remove folder(directory)
rmdir foldername
To delete whole directory, rmdir -p directoryname
rmdir will work if the folder is empty.
To delete folder contatining a file, like to delete a/b/c/d.txt, rm -r a/b/c/d.txt, then d.txt will be deleted to make the folder empty
then do rmdir -p a/b/c
Or To delete folder contatining a file, rm -r directoryname

##################cp command#########################################
cp a/b/c.txt d/e.txt..............the file c.txt will be coppied in side as e.txt, i.e. e.txt will be ceated, and content of c.txt will be copied into it. If e.txt is already there in d folder, then it will be over written. So, when file already exists, To get an option, cp -i a/b/c.txt d/e.txt
now it will as whether u want to overwrite or not. If you enter y . then it will be overwritten, otherwise not.

To copy a directory cp -R dir1 dir2...... (if dir2 does not exist) dir 2 wiil be created, and content od dir1 will be copied to dir2
cp -vR dir1 dir2......... Here dir2 exist(let). Then directly dir1 will be copied to dir2.

cp a/b/c.txt d/e/f............the file c.txt will be coppied in side d/e/f directory

########################permission###################################
user means owner. let user ram who is in cricket group has created a file test. So ram is the user or owner, cricket is the group.

drwxrwxrwx---d means its a directory, 1st 3 rwx=for owner, 2nd 3 for group, last 3 for other
-rwxrwxrwx---  - means its a file, 1st 3 rwx=for owner, 2nd 3 for group, last 3 for other
example
-rw-rw---x means its a file, owner and group has read write permossion, but other has only execute permission
7=wrx,--x=1, means rwx=111=7, --x=001=1, binary concept

Permission setting
Absolute mode: chmod command is used

chmod 764 file1 means file1 has perission settings of 7 for owner, 6 for group and 4 for other. Ingeneral woner>group>other

Symbolic mode
u=user/owner
o=other
g=group

chmod o=rw- file1 means owner has pririty rw-, chmod g+x file1 meand x permission is now added with group, chmod o-x file1 means x is now removed from other

To change user(owner) and group of a file
To change user: sudo chown username filename
To change both user and group: sudo chown username:groupname file name
To change group: sudo chgrp groupname filename


#############################less command#########################
Used to read a file

less filename
page up/dn  or up/dn keys are used. press G to go to end of the file, and press 1g or g  to go to start of the file.

So
cnt+K.....cut   (remmember cut from commamd line is cnt+shift+c)
cnt+U......paste/Uncut  (remmember paste from commamd line is cnt+shift+v)
cnt+X......exit from nano
cnt+o and then enter to save file
